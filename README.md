# Mixed_Language_Detection_Hindi-Marathi

This is code to leverage my Previous M-BERT tuned models and classify the sentences whether written in roman, native, pure Marathi or pure Hindi, or mixed Hindi and Marathi correctly.

Models used:
1) https://huggingface.co/GautamDaksh/Hindi-Marathi_Classifier
2) https://huggingface.co/GautamDaksh/Native_Marathi_Hindi_English_classifier

One model is for romanized and other one is for native and I have combined both models to get best results for mixed hindi marathi sentences whether written in romanized form or Native form.

You can use the code.py to test the model
