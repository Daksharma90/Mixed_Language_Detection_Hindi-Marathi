# Mixed_Language_Detection_Hindi-Marathi

This is code to leverage my Previous M-BERT tuned models and classify the sentences whether written in roman, native, pure Marathi or pure Hindi, or mixed Hindi and Marathi correctly.

Models used:
1) https://huggingface.co/GautamDaksh/Hindi-Marathi_Classifier
2) https://huggingface.co/GautamDaksh/Native_Marathi_Hindi_English_classifier

One model is for romanized and other one is for native and I have combined both models to get best results for mixed hindi marathi sentences whether written in romanized form or Native form.

You can use the code.py to test the model or visit the live app on streamlit:
